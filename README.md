## 1. Purpose

The Reciprocal Contribution License (RCL) is a family of license **addenda** designed to encourage community contributions by requiring certain forms of contribution back to the original project based on usage type (personal, commercial, enterprise).

This addendum complements the rights granted by the primary license and adds further usage conditions. If there is any conflict between the primary license and this addendum, the primary license takes precedence in matters of scope and permission, but the additional contribution obligations of this addendum apply as usage conditions.
